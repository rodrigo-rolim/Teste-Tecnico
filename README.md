# Teste-Tecnico

To run the code you need python installed and some libraries as: pandas, selenium, regex, beautifulsoup;

You are also going to need to download the chrome web driver, you can find in the following link: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads  
(make sure you download the same version as your browser, you can put on your "C:\Program Files (x86)" or you can change the PATH inside the code;

Fell free to add as many UFs as you want for testing on "UFs = []" i'm confident that it will work (i hope);

The .json file will be created inside the same paste as the code;

Thank you for the challenge.
